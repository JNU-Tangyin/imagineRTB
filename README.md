# Cost-effective bidding under partially observable prices landscapes

Real-time bidding has become a major mean for online advertisement exchange. The goal of a real-time bidding strategy is to maximize the benefits for stakeholders, e.g. click-through rates or conversion rates. 
However, in practise, the optimal bidding strategy for real-time bidding is constrained by three aspects: cost-effectiveness, the dynamic nature of market prices, and the issue of information scarcity in bidding values. 
To address these challenges, we propose Imagine \& Imitate Bidding (\ours), which includes Strategy Imitation and Imagination modules, to generate cost-effective bidding strategies under partially observable prices landscapes.  
Experimental results on the iPinYou and YOYI datasets demonstrate that \ours~reduces investment costs, optimizes bidding strategies, and improves future market price predictions.
