# Cost-effective bidding under partially observable prices landscapes

Real-time bidding has become a major mean for online advertisement exchange. The goal of a real-time bidding strategy is to maximize the benefits for stakeholders, e.g. click-through rates or conversion rates. 
However, in practise, the optimal bidding strategy for real-time bidding is constrained by three aspects: cost-effectiveness, the dynamic nature of market prices, and the issue of information scarcity in bidding values. 
To address these challenges, we propose Imagine \& Imitate Bidding (\ours), which includes Strategy Imitation and Imagination modules, to generate cost-effective bidding strategies under partially observable prices landscapes.  
Experimental results on the iPinYou and YOYI datasets demonstrate that \ours~reduces investment costs, optimizes bidding strategies, and improves future market price predictions.

codes are to be released soon

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.10) We add an implementation to [iTransformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625), which is the state-of-the-art model for long-term forecasting. The official code and complete scripts of iTransformer can be found [here](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer).

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.09) We added a detailed [tutorial](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/blob/main/tutorial/TimesNet_tutorial.ipynb) for [TimesNet](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ju_Uqw384Oq) and this library, which is quite friendly to beginners of deep time series analysis.
